You were once a peaceful apple traveling on a boat.

But your journey came to an end the day the boat sank, leaving you in unknown territory.

Now, you're stuck with a local banana on a strange island. Not knowing its intentions, you immediately start to fight, under the watch of a ginormous monkey - who seems really hangry.

Use the innocent coconuts you find on the beach to hit your enemy, but don't forget to feed the gorilla, or you might end in his stomach instead of the coconuts...
